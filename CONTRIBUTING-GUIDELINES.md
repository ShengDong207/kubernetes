# Contributing to Kubernetes

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Kubernetes! This document provides some basic guidelines for contributing to this project.

## Getting Started

1. **Set up your development environment**
   - Fork the repository on GitHub
   - Clone your fork locally: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kubernetes.git`
   - Add the upstream repository: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes.git`

2. **Find an issue to work on**
   - Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`
   - Join the [Kubernetes Slack](https://slack.k8s.io/) to connect with the community

3. **Make your changes**
   - Create a new branch: `git checkout -b your-branch-name`
   - Make your changes following the coding conventions
   - Add appropriate tests and documentation

4. **Submit your contribution**
   - Commit your changes with a clear message: `git commit -m "Description of changes"`
   - Push to your fork: `git push origin your-branch-name`
   - Open a pull request against the upstream repository

## Documentation Guidelines

1. **Use clear, concise language**
   - Write in simple, straightforward English
   - Avoid jargon unless necessary

2. **Follow the documentation structure**
   - Use appropriate Markdown formatting
   - Include examples where helpful
   - Update existing documentation if your changes affect it

3. **Documentation-only changes**
   - For documentation-only changes, add `[docs]` to your commit message
   - These changes typically undergo a streamlined review process

## Code Review Process

1. **Respond to reviewer feedback**
   - Address all comments and suggestions from reviewers
   - Make requested changes and push them to your branch

2. **Be patient**
   - The Kubernetes project has many contributors and reviews may take time
   - Stay engaged with your PR and respond promptly to feedback
